            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amman"> Amman : is the capital and largest city of Jordan
                and
                the country's economic, political and cultural centre. With a population of 4,007,526, Amman is the
                largest
                city in the Levant region and the sixth-largest city in the Arab world.<br><br>
                The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman is in a Neolithic site known as 'Ain Ghazal, where some of
                the
                oldest human statues ever found dating to 7250 BC were uncovered. During the Iron Age, the city was
                known as
                Ammon, home to the Kingdom of the Ammonites. It was named Philadelphia during its Greek and Roman
                periods,
                and was finally called Amman during the Islamic period. For much of the early and middle Islamic periods
                (7th–14th centuries), it served as a center for the Balqa district of Syria. Afterwards, Amman was a
                largely
                abandoned site until the late 19th century when Circassian immigrants were settled there by the Ottoman
                Empire in 1878. The first municipal council was established in 1909<br><br>
                Amman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as Transjordan's capital in 1921, and after several
                successive waves of refugees: Palestinians in 1948 and 1967; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003; and Syrians since
                2011. It was initially built on seven hills but now spans over 19 hills combining 22 areas, which are
                administered by the Greater Amman Municipality headed by its mayor Yousef Shawarbeh. Areas of Amman have
                gained their names from either the hills (Jabal) or the valleys (Wadi) they occupy, such as Jabal
                Lweibdeh
                and Wadi Abdoun. East Amman is predominantly filled with historic sites that frequently host cultural
                activities, while West Amman is more modern and serves as the economic center of the city<br><br>
                Approximately two million visitors arrived in Amman in 2014, which made it the 93rd most visited city in
                the
                world and the 5th most visited Arab city. Amman has a relatively fast growing economy, and it is ranked
                as a
                Beta− global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Moreover, it was named one of
                the
                Middle East and North Africa's best cities according to economic, labor, environmental, and
                socio-cultural
                factors. The city is among the most popular locations in the Arab world for multinational corporations
                to
                set up their regional offices, alongside Doha and only behind Dubai. It is expected that in the next 10
                years these three cities will capture the largest share of multinational corporation activity in the
                region<br><br>
