            known also as the<bold> Valley of the Moon</bold> , is a valley cut into the sandstone and granite rock in southern
            Jordan 60 km (37 mi) to the east of Aqaba; it is the largest wadi in Jordan.<br>

            Wadi Rum Protected Area was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011.<br><br>

            Wadi Rum has been inhabited by many human cultures since prehistoric times, with many cultures–including the
            Nabataeans–leaving their mark in the form of petroglyphs, inscriptions, and temple. In the West, Wadi Rum
            may be best known for its connection with British officer T. E. Lawrence, who passed through several times
            during the Arab Revolt of 1917–18.In the 1980s one of the rock formations in Wadi Rum, originally known as
            Jabal al-Mazmar (The Mountain of (the) Plague), was named "The Seven Pillars of Wisdom," after Lawrence's
            book penned in the aftermath of the war, though the 'Seven Pillars' referred to in the book have no
            connection with Rum<br> <br>

            
            Lawrence described his entrance into the Valley of Rumm, "The hills on the right grew taller and sharper, a
            fair counterpart of the other side which straightened itself to one massive rampart of redness. They drew
            together until only two miles divided them: and then, towering gradually till their parallel parapets must
            have been a thousand feet above us, ran forward in an avenue for miles. The crags were capped in nests of
            domes, less hotly red than then body of the hill; rather grey and shallow. They gave the finishing semblance
            of Byzantine architecture to this irresistible place: this processional way greater than imagination.<br>
